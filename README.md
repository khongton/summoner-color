# summoner-color

This is a work in progress. Many, many updates are expected to happen :)

The goal of this web app is to tie together two of my interests: League of Legends and programming. I want to visualize, in color, a summoner's game stats, so that they can understand their recent performance intuitively without having to comb through numbers.
