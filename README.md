# summoner-color

This is a work in progress.
The goal of this web app is to tie together two of my interests: League of Legends and programming. I want to visualize, in color, a summoner's game stats, so that they can understand their recent performance intuitively without having to comb through numbers.

UPDATE 9/25: Riot Games is currently approving my personal project for a new API key - the app is being put offline temporarily until I have received a new key.
